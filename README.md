# Celluar Automata Wolfram

In this work, we would like to conduct a detailed analysis of concepts and phenomena from the world of John Conway. We will review different game of life configurations, algorithms related to their problems as well as three-dimensional models. We will also propose some of our own spatial experiments related to 3D cellular automata. This notebook is strongly focused on using the mathematica 12.0 capabilities to best present the problem.
